To load WALI start with the launcher. Make sure WALI.pack is loaded into the game (either in mod or movie format). For your selected campaign, you need to 
edit the scripting.lua as follows:

Near the top of the file (after the variables are declared) add the following:

WALI = require "WALI/WALI"
WALI.InitialiseAttrition()

WALI.InitialiseAttrition() can be ommitted to remove attrition functionality. Any other defined commands can then be ran at any time using:

WALI.commandName()

where commandName is the name of the method
